## DESCRIPTION

There are many markup and templating systems in the
world. Why be limited to just one? Neapolitan gives
you a whole box to pick from.

* All the variety of a Whitman's Sampler.
* And all the ease of a Hershey's K.I.S.S.
* Our website has pretty colors :smile:


## Usage


```crystal
require "neapolitan"

Neapolitan.render(io_or_string)
```


## Installation
